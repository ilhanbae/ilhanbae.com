# Grouped

A collaborative calendar app for college students to manage their schedules, tasks, and group events.

## The Problem

Coordinating project meetings for college students is a headache. Between juggling different classes, jobs, and personal stuff, finding a time that works for everyone is nearly impossible.

Most students end up using different tools to manage schedules, chat, and tasks, which just makes everything more complicated. The constant platform-switching leads to fragmented communication, and tracking progress becomes a mess. It's frustrating and inefficient, especially when you're already dealing with a demanding academic schedule.

## Our Solution

We decided to tackle this problem head-on by building a platform that centralizes everything in one place. No more juggling multiple tools—just one comprehensive solution designed to simplify collaboration.

## Key Features:

- **Dynamic Calendar Views**: You can switch between monthly, weekly, and daily views, making it super easy to find a time that works for everyone.

- **Task Management**: Create, assign, and track tasks right within the calendar, so everything stays organized.

- **Real-Time Chat**: Chat with your group in real-time, no need to jump to another app.

## Wireframes

We wanted to make sure students could easily navigate through different timeframes—whether they're planning out their month, week, or just a single day. The wireframes prioritize clarity, ensuring that group schedules are easy to view and manage.

We also included features that let users quickly form groups and share schedules. The design emphasizes a clean layout, so it's easy to see who's available when, without any clutter or confusion. Everything is built to streamline coordination, making sure you spend less time figuring out logistics and more time actually getting things done.


## Customization and Filters

We also thought about professors who manage tons of groups each semester. To help them out, we added customizable filters and color-coding. This way, they can quickly spot different groups and events without getting lost in the chaos.

_Color-Coding Events and Groups:_
We proposed using seven colors, cycling them as needed to keep things visually distinct.

_Limitations:_
Assigning unique colors for a multiple groups is a challenge.

## What I've learned

Building this project gave me a much deeper understanding of the software development process. I learned firsthand how crucial effective communication and teamwork are for optimizing workflows and achieving top-notch results. This project also helped me sharpen my full-stack development skills, particularly with React.js and Tailwind CSS. On top of that, I gained valuable experience in API documentation and database management, ensuring our platform is both user-friendly and robust.

If I were to build this again, I know I could streamline the code and improve the overall design. There's always room to grow, and this project has been an incredible learning experience that's definitely boosted my confidence in tackling future challenges.
